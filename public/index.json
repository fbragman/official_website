We propose stochastic filter groups (SFG), a mechanism to assign convolution kernels in each layer to specialist or generalist groups, which are specific to or shared across different tasks, respectively. The SFG modules determine the connectivity between layers and the structures of task-specific and shared representations in the network. We employ variational inference to learn the posterior distribution over the possible grouping of kernels and network parameters.","tags":["multi-task learning","representation learning","variational inference","filter groups"],"title":"Stochastic Filter Groups for Multi-Task CNNs - Learning Specialist and Generalist Convolution Kernels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felix Bragman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553817600,"objectID":"70fcf8d8eb68c2c91eacebf3a87904df","permalink":"fbragman.github.io/talk/bir/","publishdate":"2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"fbragman.github.io/talk/bir/","section":"talk","summary":"Oral presentation at the 2019 MR in Radiotherapy symposium at the British Institute of Radiology","tags":[],"title":"Quality control in MR-only radiotherapy treatment planning using multi-task learning and uncertainty estimation","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":".\n","date":1553651412,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553651412,"objectID":"29173565a4b8a1bc5f894dc994adf5fa","permalink":"fbragman.github.io/project/multi-task/","publishdate":"2019-03-26T21:50:12-04:00","relpermalink":"fbragman.github.io/project/multi-task/","section":"project","summary":"Collection of multi-task learning algorithms developed during my post-doc","tags":["multi-task learning","representation learning","architecture learning","optimisation"],"title":"Multi-task learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":".\n","date":1553651412,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553651412,"objectID":"9ea906c573473dafc67f6cd524a3dbbb","permalink":"fbragman.github.io/project/copd/","publishdate":"2019-03-26T21:50:12-04:00","relpermalink":"fbragman.github.io/project/copd/","section":"project","summary":"Collection of the work performed during my PhD on medical image computing","tags":["semantic segmentatiion","representation learning","disease progression modelling"],"title":"Pulmonary image analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":["Felix Bragman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538002800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538002800,"objectID":"6a4f444de6cde1a1e6b63a36b3080349","permalink":"fbragman.github.io/talk/miccai/","publishdate":"2018-09-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"fbragman.github.io/talk/miccai/","section":"talk","summary":"Oral at Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2018","tags":[],"title":"Uncertainty in multitask learning: joint representations for probabilistic MR-only radiotherapy planning","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Felix Bragman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537830000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537830000,"objectID":"c2719978c2f7c6c2a90a45a8972845c6","permalink":"fbragman.github.io/talk/ers/","publishdate":"2018-09-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"fbragman.github.io/talk/ers/","section":"talk","summary":"Oral at European Respiratory Society Congress (ERS) 2018","tags":[],"title":"Disease progression patterns in COPD","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alexandra Young*","Felix Bragman*","Bojidar Rangelov","MeiLan Han","David Lynch","David J.

However, the evolution of local pulmonary damage may vary between patients with discordant effects on lung physiology. This limits the explanatory power of mean values in clinical studies. We present local disease and deformation distributions to address this limitation. The disease distribution aims to quantify two aspects of parenchymal damage: locally diffuse/dense disease and global homogeneity/heterogeneity. The deformation distribution links parenchymal damage to local volume change. These distributions are exploited to quantify inter-patient differences. We used manifold learning to model variations of these distributions in 743 patients from the COPDGene study. We applied manifold fusion to combine distinct aspects of COPD into a single model. We demonstrated the utility of the distributions by comparing associations between learned embeddings and measures of severity. We also illustrated the potential to identify trajectories of disease progression in a manifold space of COPD.","tags":[],"title":"Manifold Learning of COPD","type":"publication"}]
